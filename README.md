## 🧠 How Navigation Works

Each sidebar icon (`Home`, `Projects`, `Skills`, `LinkedIn`, etc.) corresponds to a content section. When you **click an icon**, it highlights and shows the related section by toggling CSS classes using JavaScript.

Example IDs used for mapping:

| Icon ID         | Section ID        |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| `nav-home`      | `home-id`         |
| `nav-project`   | `project-id`      |
| `nav-skill`     | `skill-id`        |
| `nav-linkedin`  | `Linkedin-id`     |
| `nav-github`    | `Github-id`       |
| `nav-contect`   | `Contect-id`      |
